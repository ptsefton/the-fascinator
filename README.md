The Fascinator
==============

Please visit our [Public site](https://sites.google.com/site/fascinatorhome/)

A [release history](release-history.md) is available.

Note: Currently two development projects are beign carried out on the fascinator for CrateIt feature and some customizations related to Mint hence there are two branches called curateit and mint. To build and play with either of them, switch to the proper branch and then build from the source.
